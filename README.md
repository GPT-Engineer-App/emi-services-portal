# emi-services-portal

make a website based on jsp, java, netbeans, which contains  an administrative portal for a company named "Shrutija" that deals with EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) services for selling products. The admin page includes functionalities such as adding new products, viewing customer lists, and generating sales reports.

Here are the key features:

Add Product Page: Admins can add new products by providing details like product name, selling price, finance options, down payment, interest rate, total finance amount, number of installments, installment amount, and detailed product description.

Customer List: Likely a page where the admin can view the list of customers.

Today's Sales: A page that might display sales transactions that occurred on the current day.

Admin Profile: A page for viewing and possibly editing the admin's profile information.

Generate Report: Admins can generate reports based on selected criteria, such as customer or product.

The provided code includes:
A sidebar for navigation.
A form for adding new products.
JavaScript functions for calculating finance-related values.
JSP code for handling the submission of the product form and a placeholder for generating a report.
The JSP backend logic is set up to handle inserting product details into a database and generating a report, though the report generation method is a dummy implementation and needs to be fleshed out with actual logic.
